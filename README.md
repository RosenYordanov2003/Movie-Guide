## I have made simple Movie app design using IMDB Api. 
## Technologies which I have used to build the project:
- JS, HTML, CSS AJAX Request to IMDB Api, I also have used Local storage to save movies into cart and to user favorite-movies collection.
### Functionality
- User can search a set of movies when enter a movie name into the search bar
- User can buy movies, can add to his favorite-movies collection and can remove it from there.
- When User buy a movie, the movie goes to the user shopping cart and can be deleted or purchased.
- User can not add already existing movie into the shopping cart.
- User can not add already existing movie into his favorite-movies collection
- User can search info about particular movie into movie-info page.
